# Unit 12 MySQL Homework: Employee Tracker


## Instructions

Design the following database schema containing three tables:

![Database Schema](Assets/schema.png)

* **department**:

  * **id** - INT PRIMARY KEY
  * **name** - VARCHAR(30) to hold department name

* **role**:

  * **id** - INT PRIMARY KEY
  * **title** -  VARCHAR(30) to hold role title
  * **salary** -  DECIMAL to hold role salary
  * **department_id** -  INT to hold reference to department role belongs to

* **employee**:

  * **id** - INT PRIMARY KEY
  * **first_name** - VARCHAR(30) to hold employee first name
  * **last_name** - VARCHAR(30) to hold employee last name
  * **role_id** - INT to hold reference to role employee has
  * **manager_id** - INT to hold reference to another employee that manager of the current employee. This field may be null if the employee has no manager
  
Build a command-line application that at a minimum allows the user to:

  * Add departments, roles, employees

  * View departments, roles, employees

  * Update employee roles


We can frame this challenge as follows:

```
As a business owner
I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
So that I can organize and plan my business
```

### Hints

* You may wish to include a `seed.sql` file to pre-populate your database. This will make development of individual features much easier.

* Focus on getting the basic functionality completed before working on more advanced features.

* Review the week's activities for a refresher on MySQL.

* Check out [SQL Bolt](https://sqlbolt.com/) for some extra MySQL help.

## Minimum Requirements

* Functional application.

* GitHub repository with a unique name and a README describing the project.

* The command-line application should allow users to:

  * Add departments, roles, employees

  * View departments, roles, employees

  * Update employee roles
